# Hi Guys! <img src="images/wave.gif" width="50px">

My name is Shakh and I'm a web developer living in Uzbekistan. My current focus is full-stack web development - mainly with React, NodeJS and related technologies.

I am writing some code to help someone with something! After all, all this is for people, and not vice versa :)

&nbsp;

### :sunrise_over_mountains: Hobbies
- table tennis, chess & I am incredibly interested in solving complex and non-trivial problems. 
&nbsp;

### :dart: Future Goals
- I'd like to help others get into software development.  It seems like a common concern is that people don't know how to get started, or no one will hire them without IT experience so I'd like to share some strategies to get past those roadblocks.
